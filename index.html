      <p style="color:LightGrey;">The 60s were one of the most creative periods in modern man's history. There were many innovations, especially in technology. By the early 1960s many people could share a single computer, using terminals to log in over phone lines. In 1965, DENDRAL, an artificial intelligence program, was created and specialized in chemistry and physics. Using if-then rules, it identified the molecular structure of organic compounds, in some cases more accurately than experts.</p>

       <div class="years">
      <p style="color:LightGrey;">The focuses of the 80s were power, money, and social image. New inventions reflected these values. The use of computer-generated graphics in movies became more mainstream. The Osborne 1, invented in 1981, became the the first mass-produced computer. It featured a 5-inch display, 64 KB of memory, a modem, and two 5.25-inch floppy disk drives, and was sold at a fair price of $1,795. Computer games and arcades saw a boom in popularity during the 80s as well.</p>

     <p style="color:LightGrey;">This is the era us sophomores have lived through and are still living through today. New technological advances seem to be made every second. The first camera phone was created in 2000 by Japan's soft bank. It inspired new phones, especially flip phones. In 2008, the Macbook Air was released, a light, thin laptop with high-capacity battery. To reduce its size, the traditional hard drive was replaced with a solid-state disk, the first mass-market computer to do so.</p>
